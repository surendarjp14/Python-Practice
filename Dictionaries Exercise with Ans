create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs

print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary

use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result

use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result

# Step 1: Create a variable and assign it a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs
my_dict = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "job": "Engineer",
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA"
}

# Step 2: Print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
# Since dictionaries are unordered in Python, we need to explicitly use the key to access the value.
# For example, accessing the value for the key "job":
print(my_dict["job"])  # Prints: Engineer

# Step 3: Use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary
key_exists = "age" in my_dict  # Checking if "age" is a key in the dictionary
print(key_exists)  # Prints: True

# Step 4: Use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary
key_not_exists = "salary" not in my_dict  # Checking if "salary" is not a key in the dictionary
print(key_not_exists)  # Prints: True
